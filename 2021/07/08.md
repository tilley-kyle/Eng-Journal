- [ ] https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1577
* Responded to question from Ronnell and merchant. Assigned to Ronnell, merchant comms yes, moved to in validation

# EOD Notes
* Weird feeling day. Not feeling like I'm on code projects but I feel like I'm still doing important work
* Learned more of the limits on when it's okay to push back at support when the ticket isn't 'right'
* * Teach them on what I did if it was simple to figure out what was wrong. Example EE-1577 showing that the email wasn't imported to the account, that's why it didn't send
* Learned that the V3 API doesn't really use account_code, but prefers account_id to look up things
* Want to push back into code work.
* * Take a ticket and run with it
