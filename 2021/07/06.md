### https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1555 embedsocial (P1)
* Related to https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1559
- [x] Investigate
* Sql query
`select
    s.subdomain,
    count(t.id) as trx_count,
    t.id,
    t.created_at,
    t.action, t.uuid
from
  `production-1-3d0475e1.dl_recurly_production_1.transactions` as t
  join `production-1-3d0475e1.dl_recurly_production_1.sites` as s on t.site_id = s.id
where
  t.site_id = 1826379027517426379 -- embedsocial
  and t.status = 'declined'
  and t.gateway_error_codes = "unknown"
  and t.gateway_type = 'braintree_blue'
  and t.message = 'Postal code is required'
  and t.created_at > '2021-05-01'
  and s.mode = 'production'
  group by s.subdomain, t.id, t.created_at, t.action, t.uuid
  order by t.created_at DESC; `
  * For some reason only affecting this sub
  * Going from code 2099 (3ds auth required) to unkown error and saying Postal Code is required
  * This is happeneing in Moneybot
  * There is no testing looking at a JSON response object (fixture is there but not used)
  - [x] Escalated to TK
  * Asked to be included with follow up on what is going wrong

### https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1559 meandmyfolf (P2)
* Related to https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1555
* Asked some follow up from Harrison. Do we have examples of what is wrong? Why did they provide the example they did?

### https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-534 GP Zip Code (P3)
* Our regex does not allow 'ZZ99 9ZZ' for GB zip code. (This is a valid 'default' zip there)
* https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/404522/ILRSpecification_2015_16_Appendix_C_Feb2015_v1.pdf
- [x] Make change in billing_info
- [ ] Make change in account
- [ ] Possible change in RJS
- [ ] Add tests for billing_info and account (possible rjs)
* Could be adding (ZZ99 9ZZ) in the regex since it is the generic code if the postal code is unkown
* Also this ^(([A-Z]{1,2}[0-9][A-Z0-9]?|ASCN|STHL|TDCU|BBND|[BFS]IQQ|PCRN|TKCA) ?[0-9][A-Z]{2}|BFPO ?[0-9]{1,4}|(KY[0-9]|MSR|VG|AI)[ -]?[0-9]{4}|[A-Z]{2} ?[0-9]{2}|GE ?CX|GIR ?0A{2}|SAN ?TA1)$
* * Found online when looking for GB postal code formats

3) One queue (future)
