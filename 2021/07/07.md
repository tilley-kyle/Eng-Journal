## Tasks
### https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1464 Splice Email (P1)
- [ ] Splice issues with john.coates@splice.com

### https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1559 meandmyfolf (P2)
* Related to https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-1555

### https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-534 GP Zip Code (P3)
* Our regex does not allow 'ZZ99 9ZZ' for GB zip code. (This is a valid 'default' zip there)
* https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/404522/ILRSpecification_2015_16_Appendix_C_Feb2015_v1.pdf
- [ ] Make change in account
- [ ] Possible change in RJS
- [ ] Add tests for billing_info and account (possible rjs)
* Could be adding (ZZ99 9ZZ) in the regex since it is the generic code if the postal code is unkown
* Also this ^(([A-Z]{1,2}[0-9][A-Z0-9]?|ASCN|STHL|TDCU|BBND|[BFS]IQQ|PCRN|TKCA) ?[0-9][A-Z]{2}|BFPO ?[0-9]{1,4}|(KY[0-9]|MSR|VG|AI)[ -]?[0-9]{4}|[A-Z]{2} ?[0-9]{2}|GE ?CX|GIR ?0A{2}|SAN ?TA1)$
* * Found online when looking for GB postal code formats

### Incident Cleanup
- [x] Ask data what would be the best way to handle pending subs
* Hard delete? (would get it out of metrics but we'd have to delete all references to it)
* Terminate/expire through script? Would still exist but the app would have that handled properly
* Any other considerations we need to think about?
* @Matthew Cryer I'm trying to find out what we need to do to fix the subscriptions in Recurly. How are the pending subs effecting analytics? Do you think we need to be expiring the pending subs, deleting them entirely(and anything referencing them), or are they not effecting the data in their pending state? Would you have time to jump on a call and talk over things or would you want to assign someone else in data? Thanks!
