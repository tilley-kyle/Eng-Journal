## Tasks
### Coupons with Becky
* Was based on ee-1453 (coupons redemptions/active endpoint was returning active and inactive coupon redemptions)
* Coupon doesn't have an active, status type bool on it. Just a redeem by date, and max_redemptions
* Coupon redemptions are only active or inactive
* * Invactive can be set by deleted_at on coupon_redemptions or temporal_unit_cd andtemporal_unit_amount on coupons table
* Coupon can be expired but the coupon_redemption may not be
* The expired? method isn't looking at the deleted_at field
