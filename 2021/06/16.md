- [ ] ee-1308
* blinkest had more questions/misunderstandings on the trial and subscription timing
* * I think they believe the trial period should be a part of the total subscription time. 1 sub with 1 wk trial = 52 total weeks, not 53 in their eyes
* responded to their questions and hoping to get more clarity back.
