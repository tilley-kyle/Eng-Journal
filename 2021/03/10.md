## Notes
### PR release process
*  QA +1 on every PR and 1 dev
* Dependencies
* * if there are multiple PRs that are related we have to call out which one should go first
* * In the 'deployment instructions' in each related PR, call out what other PRs are dependent and the order they should be deployed related to eachother
* Do it in an agile process, not waterfall

1. Ask if we can pull ticket into the sprint (if there is another ticket that is dependent)
2. Have a small conversation about what is going to need to happen
* testing, dependencies, will people have time to review
