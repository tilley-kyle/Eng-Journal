## Tasks
- [x] Learning time (finish rebasing, rescue/error handling)
- [ ] Tool imporvements
- [ ] optimal Blue if sheet comes in
- [x] Test Wallet import feature
## Notes
### Wallet testing
* why not name the 2nd cards file something specific like 'cards_secondary.csv'
* * How will the primary/secondary cards be given to us?
* * Will each cards file be just primary cards OR secondary cards or will they be mixed?

* Things to break
* * How to select each sub goes to

#### Steps and Results
1. `make prep` on accounts and cards1 file
* * 10/10 success
2. `make run` on accounts and cards1 file
* * 10/10 success
3. `make wallet_prep` with cards2 switched to cards
* * 10/10 success
4. `make wallet_run`
* * reported 10/10 success
* * Checking in UI, looks to be successful
5. `make prep` on subs
* * 10/10 success
6. `make run` on subs
* * 10/10 success
7. `make step2` on subs
* * 10/10 success
8. `make wallet_billing` on subs
* * 10/10 success in reporting (not sure what I'm supposed to see in the UI to say that though)
