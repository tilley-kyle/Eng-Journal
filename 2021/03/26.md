## Notes

### 90 day review
* coffee meet with stacey
* jump to definition in vscode
* **FEEDBACK**
* Goals, right a why column
* Scoping
* * estimate on the high side
* * change to monospace fonts
* * The amount of things you want to take on almost always out pace your time to actually complete them. It's great to be aspirational, but keep a keen eye on your estimations and task lists, app or learning, and rank them into priority order. That should help with getting the seemingly endless number of things that you want to learn and do accomplished.
* app knowledge
* time management
