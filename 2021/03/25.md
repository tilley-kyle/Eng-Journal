### Meeting with Emmanual
An example for running a test from terminal:
NODE_ENV=test ./node_modules/.bin/mocha --inspect-brk --full-trace test/certification/mes.test.js
Put a debugger wherever you want in the code before running the test, open up chrome: chrome://inspect/#devices
Then you should be able to see an inspect button under "Remote Target".
Also you might need to configure an additional port under "Configure" such as 127.0.0.1:9229
