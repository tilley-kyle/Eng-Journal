## Tasks
* Pull the method out for the http call and put it in a separate file (like the ask questions function)
* call it in the import runer and part 2
* in part2 supply it the gateway for a modify subs

* Test gateway_code issues
* * if gate_way code is being set properly, put in how I'm currently doing it. Update the sub. Check where the transaction is being sent
* * * Gateway code is going in, but when the colleciton_method is 'manual' it uses the default gateway code, if it is 'automatic' it works as expected
* * if the subs collection_method is staying manual, keep it as it, update the sub, check where the transaction is being sent
