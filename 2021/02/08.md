## Tasks
- [ ] mlslistings
- [x] https://jira.recurly.net/browse/PAY-7367
- [ ] two small items in todo log


## Notes
### ticket pay-7367
* Two successful transacdtions to the invoice
* * about an hour apart
* * the second one was refunded on Dec 8th (transactions were Aug 24)
* Looks to be a double billing with errors that have been fixed
* * Can't say for sure though since we can't access logs that far back to see query responses
* Adyan gateway, non-queryable anyway


### transactions
* Jobs
* * both invoiceless transactions
* * multi invoice
* * remove missing in RA and duplicated transaction

### Hockey Messup

Use in script that takes
* CSV with header line (trans uuid)
* use the Transaction.transaction do wrapped in an each
* clean up error messages
* uncomment out 'admin_activity'
* * activity.new (lex and judi know)
* if statement outside of the transaction do block and rescue block


* **CAN HAVE THEM (OP) FILTER BY ERRORS**
