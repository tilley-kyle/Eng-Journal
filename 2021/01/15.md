## Tasks
- [ ] Creativebug
- [ ] decrypt ticket
- [ ] make ticket for compiler failure script to automate/'make' command
- [x] TMUX graceful graceful exit with preloaded information
* * when you run `tmux make_run` it loads the parameters into a file so if you need to graceful exit you can do it quickly
- [ ] part2 report successes vs part1

## Notes

## EOD Day Notes
Notes after talking with Doug M.:
Once decrypting a file with the `gpg-decrypt` I can move the decrypted file out of the newly created folder and into the base subdomain folder. I can then unmount the created directory and remove it.
Workflow will look like:
decrypt file given to us by merchant
move decrypted file into base subdomain in secure
follow those instructions to decrypt cards
move decrypted file into base subdomain in secure
`scrub` data
use the `fusermount` script to unmount at the end of a session
