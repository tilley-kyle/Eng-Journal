### Creative Bug notes
**JIRA TICKET 8488**
* gpg file was in drop box
* mapping file was linked in there (no access to it at first)
#### Import Decryption steps
* From Jira ticket, open the the accounts file (map) in sheets and save it as a CSV (download as csv)
* import the accoutns file into the import box `gcloud compute scp --project=devops-f467c7d5 --zone=us-east4-a ~/local_file.txt import-export:~/`
* run the new_import.sh script and start the subdomain
* * SELECT
	a.*
FROM
	sites s inner join api_keys a on s.id = a.site_id
WHERE
	s.subdomain like "creativebug";
* * (will need to get the api key from tableplus)
* move the gpg file into the import box (provided in the ticket)
* `gpg-decrypt.sh`   # use this to decrypt the file (these are file instructions to decrypt the instructions)
* * Use same password as import box log in for simplicity
* You will need to use the key:value pairs on last pass
* * This might tell you after you try one which one is right
* * This gets me a new file in my secure fold that is instructions to get the card file
* cd into created fold with a decrypted file in the secure fold (instructions to the the enrypted card file)
* connect to sftp folder using the provided instructions. Path to server and and password are provided in the instructions
* cd into where the encrypted file live in the sftp folder
* `get filename` # to download out of stfp to imoprt box
* `bye` to exit the sftp
* `gpg-decrypt` again to decrypt the cards file
* move and rename to cards.csv into the data folder for subdomain
* inspect that data

## Creative Bug Notes
* Incorrect Headers
* * paymentMethod.id (should be billing_paypal_billing_agreement_id)
* * renewal_billing_cycles (used twice)
* * pan_unit_amount (should be plan_unit_amount)
* * add_on_code_1 (should just be add_on_code?)
* * Defect in the subs mapping file
* * * add_on_quantity and add_on_unit_amount
* * * only have add_on_code and add_on_id in docs
* * shipping_amount (not in docs?)
* * No headers in cards file
* * no expiration dates in cards file

* check shipping_method_code in db



## Things to fix in imports
* `custom_acount_fileds` vs `subscriptions_custom_fields`
