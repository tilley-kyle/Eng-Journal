## Tasks
- [ ] creativebug import
- [x] setup_batches improvemtns

## EOD Notes
* non snake case headers in an import will brake things because our scripts downcase everything
* the accounts mapping file needs a conditional to watch out for blank fields
* change billing_paypal_billing_agreement_id in mapping.rb
* when importing paypal, don't forget to unassign the join data to the card info
* :g/thing_to_delete
* save reports from prep as csv


## Notes
### Talk with Jordan
* 2 phases
* * script clean up (what we're doing now)
* * recurly app work, expose api so em can take over entire import
* Want to move to to one run for everything
* recurly_skip_auth
* * super secret param for billing/subs
* dig in to csv parser to see what's going on
* batching script
* * cards file can be UTF-16 sometimes.
* * use 'rescue' for reading encryption type.
* * try UTF-8, if it doesn't work, try UTF-16, if not try Windows-1252...
* Accounts validator
* * watch out for CSV.open and reading whole file into memory
* * Only want to read line by line
* Find a way to look at the enryption type of a file without writing the whole thing into memory
