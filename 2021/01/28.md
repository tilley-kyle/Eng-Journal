## Tasks
- [ ] Meet with EE team
- [ ] Finish iheartmedia import
- [ ] Finish optimal blue
## EOD NOTES
* Finishe OB import
* * Well need to run some querires in table plus to make sure I did, but besides that it's done
* helped Becky and Bennett
* Knowledge handoff with the team. Moving to bugs soon!

## Notes
### Intro to Transactions
* slack transaction issues
* * sling sheet of 7 cases of issues
* * 3 we care about related to potential potential billing
* * Queries weren't working as expected (capped at 100 issues)
* timestamps and date partitions and created at. Used this to scope the queries
* Look at RA talking to moneybot
* * moneybot loses logs after a month. Have to use bigquery for that
* Have script to run gateway query (doesn't work for stripe / stipe payment intense)
* * 'the verb is wrong'

* Subdomain we care about the most, dish digital/sling
* Investigation:
* * Use gray log, absolute time.
* * only have logs in gray logs for a ~month
* * Stack Driver may be able to help us
**RULE**
* Any merchant over $1000 or transaction over $250
* Settled means it passed, moved the money
* Follow the transaction from RA to finish, where ever that may be
* * except (those last 2 data cols) to reduce query size ## SOMETHING LEX SAID ON BIGQUERY
* Run the other script (support script) goes right to moneybot (moneybot only handles POST requests)
* Graylog will be my friend
* referenc_id is set by the gateway


## Optimal Blue
5. Create PR to clear manual invoice counts:
# Query to validate manual invoice counts:
# SELECT id, manual_invoice_count
# FROM recurly_production.stats_recurly_billing
# WHERE site_id = (SELECT id FROM sites WHERE subdomain = 'optimalblue')
# AND manual_invoice_count > 0;
SET @manual_invoice_count_id :=
(SELECT id
  FROM recurly_production.stats_recurly_billing
  WHERE site_id = (SELECT id FROM sites WHERE subdomain = 'optimalblue')
  AND stat_date = '2021-01-28');

UPDATE recurly_production.stats_recurly_billing SET manual_invoice_count = (manual_invoice_count - 497), updated_at = UTC_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE id = @manual_invoice_count_id;

SET @manual_invoice_count_id = NULL;

Query to validate manual invoice counts:
SELECT id, manual_invoice_count
FROM recurly_production.stats_recurly_billing
WHERE site_id = (SELECT id FROM sites WHERE subdomain = 'optimalblue')
AND manual_invoice_count > 0;
