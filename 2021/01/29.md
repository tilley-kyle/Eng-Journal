## Notes

* When trying to fix things, don't break them in the first place
* When querying, learn to break things down and

* Need to add a line checking if the the add_on_unit_amount is already fixed
* * log a response saying we might need to check if they customer needs a refund
* * 58b9ecf3583d882026701f4e0f8e90f8 (example)
* * * Was charged 42.83 dollars that needs a refund (refund that immediate change)

* * * also was 'fixed'
* * Find others

* If the merchant has already gone in we don't touch but log
* * enablement has to go back to talk to merchant (we charged them, refund)
* Update subscriptoin

* copy his script into the local repo and rails run it
* * updates the add_on_unit_amount
* * make sure it skips the the 'right' ones
* * renew the subscription to see if it renews at the right price
* * * sub.current_period_ends_at = Time.current

        Subscriptions::SubscriptionRenewer.renew! sub
