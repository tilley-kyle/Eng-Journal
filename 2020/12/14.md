**Databases!!**
* Bigquery is the fast query thing, maybe don't use this right now...

## Final Thoughts
* Overall a relatively 'easy' day. Luckily I don't have whatever is plaguing my teamamtes but I'm anxious that maybe I missed something
* Got some more API route set up
* Started learning how to make queries in SQL, that is fun
* Seeing how the pieces connect better now, how to use my different apps
* Need to keep understanding the Recurly App Commands
