    Writing routes
## Tasks    
    Write my API routes to the QA endpoints. 
    Take notes on where stuff doesn't seem to be correct in the docs
## Notes   
 **Create an accounts billing information**
* docs say required fields for running with a CC are...
  * First name
  * last_name
  * number
  * month 
  * year
* 422 error asking for...
  * street1
  * city 
  * postal_code
  * country
  * region
  * these should be nested in an 'address' field
