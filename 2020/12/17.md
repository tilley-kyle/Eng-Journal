## end of day
* felt good to work through all the steps making data and checking why it's wrong
* learned to use graylogs a bit more
* still need to work on reading the mapping file more and making changes to it
* did a 1000 record import, took about 3:30. 1mil record would take about 55 hours at this rate!?!?
* THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR ON IMPORTS
* * shipping is enabled
* * date formatted right (mm, yyyy)
* * watch out for custom header
* * * delete empty trailing fields if none are use
* * * make sure used ones are entered into api
* * phone number is 10 digits
* * mapping file is looking at the right place for the data, 
* * * aka data is looking at joins when needed as apposed to source
**INTERESTING BUG MAYBE**
* when we edited the mapping.rb file we changed some of the "source_file" pointers to "join_file" in the billing info section, 4 of my 5 entries then worked. Then I changed the "zip" on line 89,53 to "billing_zip" and then the final record passed through. Why did the first 4 make it and all of Gil's and Ray's passed

## Notes
* Calebs recommendations
* * vimux, vim-test, tcomment_vim, fzf, nerdtree, vim-endwise
uses. vundle as his plugin manager
