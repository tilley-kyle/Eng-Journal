- [ ] Make changes that I need to in the batches setup function
- [ ] Forget today, internet service was shit

## notes for end of day
* Keep on top of my tickets and PRs. Make sure it gets through the whole process


## Notes
### Ideas to get used to Ruby code and the Code Base
* REGEX across the entire Recurly codebase
* * Use to find the top 25 methods used
* * one line scrip can do this
* * Find the frequency of method calls
* * 'grep' ?
* * anything with a dot at the beginning but not after
* Read through the code base
* * '1000 lines of code a day'
* * * Maybe 2 files?
* * Take notes on things that stand out
* * * What don't I know

###  In future job
* Don't be afraid to refactor code to make it more legible

### Script to map and batch
* `ruby setup_import.rb site-subdomain batch_size file_path starting_batch_index

### blue variables
* Constants are in all caps
* * will warn you but will let you overwrite it
* * look up .freeze

### Instance varibables
* @ at the front of a variable
* * maybe global variable to the file


## Numbers
* 600k subs
* 100k accounts takes 6 minutes
* 1.2 seconds pers subscription record

## things after lunch
* Gen file created double header
* Fix batches_setup to run from the right area/make folders to the right area
* copy the configuration files

## WHEN MAKING A PR
**MAKE SURE THE BASE BRANCH IS PROPER**
* I need to make sure I check the changes in the PR on github
* steps to do a pull request
1. review the files changed in the github ui
* * check for spelling or basic errors
* * NIT: for nitpicky problems
2. run the script/files based on what they should do
* When Making a PR
1. make sure the base branch is correct (usually not master/main)
## for imiports of subs,
* take note of when the import started
* log when it finishes as well
* **WHAT IS DREW DOING IN THE SUBSCRIPTIONS?**
* * Is this a new script
