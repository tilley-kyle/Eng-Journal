# FROM recurly_production.stats_recurly_billing
# WHERE site_id = (SELECT id FROM sites WHERE subdomain = 'kyle_imports1')
# AND manual_invoice_count > 0;
SET @manual_invoice_count_id :=
(SELECT id
  FROM recurly_production.stats_recurly_billing
  WHERE site_id = (SELECT id FROM sites WHERE subdomain = 'kyle_imports1')
  AND stat_date = '2020-12-18');

UPDATE recurly_production.stats_recurly_billing SET manual_invoice_count = (manual_invoice_count - 888), updated_at = UTC_TIMESTAMP()

SET @manual_invoice_count_id = NULL;
