## Wrap Up
* need to check over the weekend when I get permissions for the SCRUM videos. Links are in the invite in my calendar
* Want to make a script to auto make batches and TMUX windows open for the appropriate amount of batches
* I was tired today, probably need to make sure to eat more
* ran into interesting problem when Ra made 100000 records of test data for batches. Her script skipped some lines in the data which caused some join errors. Most likely cause was the processor was given too many tasks (it was writing 20 csv files with 10k records in each of them) at the same time. Only possible guess of what is going wrong. 
### Goal for the weekend
* Write a script to create the batch files
* * So turn one big file into a bunch of small files and borken apart in the proper format in the file structure
* STRETCH GOAL: Have the script open up the proper amount of TMUX sessions needed as well
## Notes
* gpg --import solutions-import-key.gpg
