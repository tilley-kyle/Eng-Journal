## Final rundown
Today was another suspiciously smooth day
* got the subs import working
* I want to work on scripts
* i'm feling much better about moving aroun through the interfaces, still have some work to do
* My note taking is getting better as well, I still want to try doing a different way of following along and not trying to take notes specifically

## Notes

* make a csv file prettier in VIM
* * %!column -t
* file encoding 
* * we will want to be using utf-8
* * :echo &fenc     # this will check currecnt encoding
* * :set encoding=utf-8
* stat filename   # command in bash to check edit times on the files
* **SCRIPTS** 
* start in VS code
* copy the test import data file somewhere else
* * for practice it can be anywhere
* * cp it to wherever I want to put as long as I'll be able to put a ruby file with it
* * * might have to be in certain foulder, for instance into a specifici repo for rights to make changes in gem file
* grab the headers from the test data file and paste it into the ruby file
* highlight first comma, cmd + d to highlight all commas.
* hit enter (should now be vert line)
* comment out every line
* psuedo code
* * map values to test data
* * add to csv row
* * write a csv row to file
* * wrap hole function multiple times -- do 3.times
* gem we will use is CSV  -- require 'csv' - to top of file
* * google how to use CSV gem
* * gem install csv  # in terminal
* * learn how to write a new fle
* File.open("path to file, "a+") do |row|
    row.write "\n some data"    # alternate     row << "/n some data" 
    end
* copy over the headers down and tur them into a method
* create them into an object 
* install faker gem
* set the values of the objects
* learn what 'secure random ruby' is
* * require that one in and use it
* use that to populate my fields
* * will need to add the @domain.com for email though
* card reference number will need to be incremented
* use csv << method().values
**TO WRITE SE FILE NOT CSV**
* You're f'd and zoned out improperly
**DON'T CREATE TEST DATA OVER 1000 RECORDS**
