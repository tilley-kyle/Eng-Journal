# EE-581 Chartmogul Invoice total amount splits into 2 payment transactions
[Jira](https://jira.recurly.net/browse/EE-581)

## 04/19/2021
* Investigating
* trigger 3DS failure
* * 4000-0000-0000-0044 seems to be the card number for that

So far:
* can't find why the invoice got broken in two transactions
* It looks like when invoice failing because of requesting 3dS2 auth the coupon is in the request body
* * https://graylog.production.recurly.net/messages/ry_ra-web_330/1417c1c0-89d6-11eb-a99b-8add52cb52af
* and when it finally goes through it is no longer in the request body
* * https://graylog.production.recurly.net/messages/ry_ra-web_330/3829c404-89d6-11eb-a3ca-2660d641258c
* For some reason the requests that succeed with 3DS no longer have the coupon code attached to them, only in the first step when they need to then go out and get the 3DS token
