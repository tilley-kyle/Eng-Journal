# DC-15 Query Infinite Looping
### Link
[Jira Ticket](https://jira.recurly.net/browse/DC-15)

## Description
We have made some great updates to the query functionality, however, we seem to have also introduced an infinite loop into the transaction query where if we get X error every time, we will continue to queue a query in 10 minutes forever.  We need to ensure that we have end states for the query functionality so that we do not accidentally cause more problems down the road if there were to be a large number of these that could crash the queues, or other problems.
## Acceptance Criteria
Transactions that cannot be found or otherwise return a value that says - look again in X minutes, have a way to exit that endless query state

## Things I've noticed
* Message `[Query API] Submitting query to Moneybot`
* * That message is made up in query_producer.rb

## Things to look like
### Error type 104
* What to payproflow docs say about error type
* what other things in successful (non reduplicated) queries say about this (other 104 responses that aren't being requeried)
* Maybe look to the [payproflow recurly respons.js](https://github.com/recurly/moneybot/blob/9896422cf75e05e77a3c206c8da4e6e170bdaafd/lib/gateways/payflow/response.js#L54)
* Could change definition to 'processor unavailable'

## Testing
* unit testing
* to get a result value of '104' send a dollar amount of '1104'
* Check for automatic queries afterwards
* seems to not work on purchases (the problem transactions found were refunds)
* * [testing example](https://github.com/recurly/moneybot/pull/1429/files)
